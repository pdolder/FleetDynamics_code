# FleetDynamics_code
Code for fitting the different models in the paper:
"A comparison of fleet dynamics models for predicting fisher location choice".

Data generation comes from simulations using "MixFishSim" (https://github.com/pdolder/MixFishSim), published as:

Dolder, P. J., Minto, C., Guarini, J. M., & Poos, J. J. (2020). Highly resolved spatiotemporal simulations for exploring mixed fishery dynamics. Ecological Modelling, 424, 109000 (doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109000).

The analysis requires the following steps:

1. Run "model_Runs.R"
2. Run "DSVM_Runs.R" (this is an updated DSVM run)
3. Run "model_eval.R.

4.
